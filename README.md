# 🚨 ScamGuard AI  
### AI-Powered Internship & Job Scam Detection System

ScamGuard AI is a web-based AI application designed to help students and fresh graduates identify **fake or suspicious internship and job offers** before applying.

It analyzes offer text using **Google Gemini AI** and provides an **explainable credibility score**, helping users make informed decisions and avoid scams.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Students increasingly receive fake internship and job offers through platforms such as:

- Email  
- WhatsApp  
- Instagram  
- Telegram  

These offers often:
- Ask for **registration or training fees**
- Create urgency using phrases like *“limited seats”* or *“apply immediately”*
- Provide **vague job descriptions** or **unrealistic promises**

As a result, students face:
- Financial loss  
- Data misuse  
- Wasted time and missed genuine opportunities  

Existing platforms either focus on job listings or provide a simple **fake/real classification** without explaining *why* an offer is risky.

## 💡 Solution Overview

ScamGuard AI addresses this problem by providing a **simple, explainable, AI-driven analysis** of internship and job offer text.

Users can paste any offer text into the application, and the system:

- Analyzes the content using **Google Gemini AI**
- Detects scam-related language patterns
- Generates a **credibility score (0–100)**
- Provides a **clear explanation** of why an offer appears **Safe, Risky, or Scam-like**

The focus is on **prevention and awareness before applying**, not after damage occurs.
